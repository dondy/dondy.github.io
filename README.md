TODO:
  - Begin with .5 exercise/transition time, increase up to .0, decrease back to .5 over the total course of exercise.
    - Maybe increase curve depending on week, so for >9 you'd have a transition time of 0.
  - Gradual Workup from 20 to 30+ (does that even still make sense?) minutes of exercise (week 1-9).
  - Check for having at least 3 exercise sessions per week, if necessary restart the week for exercise.
    - requires persistent date tracking (WAT DO?!)

can't find a decent source for the HICT with Body Weight pdf.
